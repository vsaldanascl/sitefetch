### Match specific pages

Use the `-m, --match` flag to specify the pages you want to fetch:

```bash
sitefetch https://vite.dev -m "/blog/**" -m "/guide/**"
```

The match pattern is tested against the pathname of target pages, powered by micromatch, you can check out all the supported [matching features](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch#matching-features).

### Content selector

We use [mozilla/readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) to extract readable content from the web page, but on some pages it might return irrelevant contents, in this case you can specify a CSS selector so we know where to find the readable content:

```sitefetch
sitefetch https://vite.dev --content-selector ".content"
```
